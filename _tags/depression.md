Depression can manifest in various ways, including persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and difficulty concentrating. Depression can also lead to physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite, and sleep disturbances. It is not to be confused with
general low mood, feeling sad or 'fed up. These feelings can last for weeks and become so bad that they interfere with daily life.
