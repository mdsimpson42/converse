Anxiety is the feeling of being nervous, tense or worried. Most of us feel anxious at some point, often in anticipation of something,
or during times of stress or when dealing with big changes in our lives. However, it is possible to get into situations where these
feelings become overwhelming, affecting our lives and potentially leading to anxiety attacks. There are various methods of managing
anxiety, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and medication.
