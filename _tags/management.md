A person's line manager, and the office culture in their workplace, can have the biggest impact on their mental health.
We believe that it is vital to create an environment that is supportive, inclusive and understanding; one in which
people feel comfortable discussing their mental health and seeking help when they need it. If people raise issues early,
it is usually easier to do something to address them before they grow into more serious problems.

These blog posts discuss mental health and neurodiversity in the workplace, and what line managers, team leaders,
HR and other colleagues can do to support their teams.
