We've all experienced the feeling of crunch time, when deadlines are approaching we have to work extra hard, often
putting in long hours to get the project over the line. However, if you work too hard for too long, then it can become overwhelming.

These not only affect us, but reduce our productivity, so it is in everyone's best interest to avoid.
