    The idea was to teach people to use task management tools and productivity frameworks.
    However, the goal was not to make them more productive, but to help them manage their 
    workload more effectively, leading to better life-work balance and mental health.
    The project is still in its infancy, we are looking for people to help us develop the idea,
    contribute to the course content and run the workshops.
