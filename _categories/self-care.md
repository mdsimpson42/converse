We all face a range of challenges in our lives, and working in research software presents
its own set of challenges. Organisations like the RSE Society and the Software Sustainability Institute
are working hard to improve things, but there are lots of things that are outside of our control.
One thing that's easier to control is how we take care of ourselves. Self-care is important,
and there are a number of ways to manage your workload, life-work balance and mental health.

The following posts contain a range of self-care tips and advice.
As with a lot of the things on this site, some of these tips may not work for you,
but we've collected submissions from a wide and diverse range of people, so hopefully you
will find something in the posts below that works for you.
