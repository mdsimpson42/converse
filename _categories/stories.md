The tagline of ConveRSE is "Let's talk about Mental Health". That is no accident!
We want to encourage people to be more open about mental health. By sharing our stories,
will can make people feel seen and help them realise that they are not alone.
Being more open about mental health means that we are more likely to raise issues
before they turn into larger problem, allowing people to do something about them before
they overwhelm us.

The following blog posts are from people who are willing to share their experiences
with a range of mental health problems.
