Working remotely has become part of most of our lives since the events of 2020. Working from home has its own challenges for
our mental and physical health, so I've compiled a list of tips to look after yourself while working remotely.

Working from home has its advantages for everyone involved - if your employer trusts its staff and doesn't treat
them like children, that is! However, it is still important to look after yourself properly while you're not in the office.
As someone who used to regularly work from home during my PhD, and usually worked remotely at least once per week even
before the pandemic, I've compiled a list of tips for self-care in the home office.

This is based on [this blog post](https://mdsimpson.co.uk/2020/03/working-from-home-tips/) that I wrote at the start of lockdown,
aiming to help my friends and colleagues adapt to 'the new normal'. I've updated it and added a few additional notes based on my
experiences during and after the pandemic.

## Tips

I’ve broken down my advice for working from home into seven key points:

1. **Get Dressed** – It can be tempting to stay in your PJs all day, but I find I am happier and more productive if I make the effort to shower and get dressed before starting work. Like with some of the other tips, it can also help break up the day.

2. **Get Away** – Just as you should in the office anyway, get away from your desk/workspace every so often. Walk around the house, make a cuppa, do some little chores... Particularly if you’re struggling to concentrate or are stuck on a problem, you may find that getting away for a few minutes and then coming back to it will really help. I often watch an episode of something on my lunch break to help make sure I get a proper break.

3. **Get Outside** – Getting some fresh air is essential. A short walk before and/or after work can help break up your day too. I recommend listening to Podcasts/Audiobooks while you wander. If it’s raining (or you're in lockdown!), open a window to let some fresh air in.

4. **Get Active** - It's not just important to get away from your desk. You need exercise too. In addition to going outside for a walk, consider improvising some short exercises using stuff around the house as weights, if you don't want to buy them. I have an adjustable desk and a treadmill.

5. **Get Drinks & Snacks** – Preferably healthy(ish) ones; you’ll be surprised how quickly an entire packet of chocolate biscuits can disappear when you’re concentrating on something else! Remember to drink plenty of water/juice, as well as tea! Sometimes your body confuses hunger and thirst, so drinking plenty is a good way to minimise unnecessary snacking (this helped when I was trying to lose weight for my wedding).

6. **Get some D** – The body creates vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin when outdoors. It can help with tiredness, is good for bones and can help the immune system. I was advised to take some Vitamin D supplements by my GP while I was suffering from depression and insomnia. Boots do their own supplements, which are pretty cheap – get the 25μg dose if you can.

7. **Get some [Craic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craic)** – Even I sometimes find that I need human interaction! Some podcasts/YouTube videos can fill the gap, as can messenger, but a phone/video call every so often is better - meeting in person is best. See if a friend can meet for lunch or a coffee. Checking in will help support your friends and colleagues, and talking about stuff will help you feel better too.

8. **Get Focussed** – If you are actually knuckling down to work, try to avoid distractions. Don’t leave Facebook open in your browser or have your phone right next to your keyboard. Listening to music – with a comfortable pair of headphones if you don’t want to disturb others – is a good way to help you focus, you just have to find the right kind of music that works for you. For me, it’s songs that I am very familiar with, or acoustic and instrumental songs with no vocals that aren’t too distracting. Work in 20 minute sprints, then switch to something else. Consider using a tool or app to help keep track of all your tasks. You want a good life-work balance, and to be able to switch off from work at the end of the day, and nothing will kill your personal life like feeling that you haven't been productive enough.

## Final Thoughts

Working from home can be challenging and your experience will vary depending on your personality and what policies, instructions and advice your employer provides. But, a little self-care, determination and patience will help you adapt to this new style of working. These are the tips that I have found most helpful and, hopefully, some of them will work for you. Best of luck!
