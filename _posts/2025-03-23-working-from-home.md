Working remotely has become part of our lives for many of us since the events of 2020. Working from home presents
a unique set of challenges for our mental and physical health, so I've compiled a list of tips to look after yourself while
working remotely.

---

Working from home has many advantages for everyone involved - if your employer trusts its staff and doesn't treat
them like children, that is! However, it is still important to look after yourself properly while you're not in the office.
As someone who used to regularly work from home during my PhD and at least once per week even before the pandemic,
I've compiled a list of tips for self-care in the home office.

This is based on [this blog post](https://mdsimpson.co.uk/2020/03/working-from-home-tips/) that I wrote at the start of lockdown,
aiming to help my friends and colleagues adapt to 'the new normal'. I've updated it and added a few additional notes based on my
experiences during and after the pandemic.

## Tips

I’ve broken down my advice for working from home into eight key points:

### 1 - Get Dressed

It can be tempting to stay in your PJs all day, or go for the classing working-from-home look of a shirt and PJ bottoms.
However, I find I am happier and more productive if I make the effort to have shower and get dressed before starting work.
Like with some of the other tips, it can also help break up the day and help set a boundary between 'morning time' and
'work time'.

### 2 - Get Away

Just as you should in the office anyway, get away from your desk/workspace every so often. Walk around the house,
make a cuppa, do some little chores... Particularly if you’re struggling to concentrate or are stuck on a problem, you may find that
getting away for a few minutes and then coming back to it will really help. I often sit in the living room and watch an episode
of something while I eat my lunch to help make sure I get a proper break.

### 3 - Get Outside

Another obvious one, but one that can be easy to neglect. Even walking around the block for ten minutes is better than
spending the whole day cooped up inside. This is another thing that can help break up the day. Why not walk around the block
"to work" in the morning, and "back home" in the evening?  I recommend listening to Podcasts/Audiobooks while you wander,
if you need to feel like you're "doing something" to make the most of that time.

If it’s raining (or you're in lockdown!), at least be sure to open a window and/or the blinds to let some light and fresh air in.

### 4 - Get Active

It's not just important to get away from your desk. You need exercise too. In addition to going outside for a walk,
consider improvising some short exercises using stuff around the house as weights, if you don't want to buy any equipment.
I have an adjustable desk and a treadmill that I can set up under the desk, so I can walk while I'm working, or while I'm
gaming, if I'm taking a break.

### 5 - Get Drinks & Snacks

Preferably healthy(ish) ones; you’ll be surprised how quickly an entire packet of chocolate biscuits can
disappear when you’re concentrating on something else! Remember to drink plenty of water/juice, as well as tea! Sometimes your body
confuses hunger and thirst, so drinking plenty is a good way to minimise unnecessary snacking and avoid putting on weight, if you're not
getting the same amount of steps that you would if you were going into work (this helped when I was trying to lose
weight for my wedding).

### 6 - Get some Vitamin D

The body creates vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin when outdoors. It can help with tiredness, is good
for bones and can help the immune system. I was advised to take some Vitamin D supplements by my GP while I was suffering
from depression and insomnia. Boots do their own supplements, which are pretty cheap. I was advised to the 25μg dose, though
apparently 15μg is the recommended daily intake for adults.

### 7 - Get some [Craic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craic)

Even I - a borderline autistic, introvert - sometimes find that I need human interaction! I've found that podcasts/YouTube videos can fill the gap,
in a pinch, as can messenger, but a phone/video call every so often is better (and, of course, meeting in person is best!). See if a friend
can meet for lunch or a coffee. Checking in will help support your friends and colleagues, and talking about stuff will help you feel
better too, but just spending some time in other people's company can help lift your mood.

### 8 - Get Focussed

If you are actually knuckling down to work, try to avoid distractions. Don’t leave Facebook open in your browser or
have your phone right next to your keyboard. Sometimes it can be useful to turn off work emails and chat apps too, to allow
you to work without interruptions. (For more on this, see my [blog post about setting boundaries]({{site.baseurl}}/2025/09/28/setting-boundaries).)

I find that listening to music – with a comfortable pair of headphones if you don’t want to disturb others
– is a good way to help you focus. You just have to find the right kind of music. For me, it’s songs that I am very familiar
with, or acoustic and instrumental tracks with no vocals that aren’t too distracting.

If you're struggling to focus, work in 20 minute sprints, then switch to something else. Consider using a tool or app to help keep track
of all your tasks. You want a good life-work balance, and to be able to switch off from work at the end of the day, and nothing will kill
your personal life like feeling that you haven't been productive enough! Ticking things off a to-do list can also give you a sense of achievement
and give you a little boost to your mood.

## Final Thoughts

Working from home can be challenging and your experience will vary depending on your personality and what policies, instructions and advice
your employer provides. But, a little self-care, determination and patience will help you adapt to this new style of working. These are the
tips that I have found most helpful and, hopefully, some of them will work for you.
