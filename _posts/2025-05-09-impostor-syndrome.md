Have you ever been working on a project and felt like you didn't deserve to be there? Chances are, you have experienced
syndrome; a feeling of self-doubt and inadequacy that is a common experience in the research software community.
But is there anything we can do about it?

## Impostor syndrome

One of the most common questions I get asked when I give my mental health talk is "how do I deal with impostor syndrome?"
Common responses to Dave Horsfall's mental health survey included "not feeling like I belong", "not fitting in" and
"activities outside my comfort zone".

And is it any surprise? Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and other Research Technical Professionals (RTPs)  
are often expected to be experts in a range of different technologies. We have to work with world leaders in subjects
that we know nothing about, and we are expected to quickly learn enough about these new domains to be able to
contribute effectively to a project. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a lot of self-doubt,
especially when comparing yourself to others with more specialized knowledge or experience.

But the reality is, we are there for a reason. We know how to engineer software, optimise code, test and deploy
applications. We can write quality code better than the researchers. That is why we are there!

## 'Fake it til you make it'

A few people have said impostor syndrome is "just part of the job" and something that you will learn to live with.
It's easy to dismiss this kind of thinking, but I think there is an element of truth to it. You can't wait until
you feel confident to start doing the job. You have to get started, do the best you can and learn as you go.

You get used to walking into a room full of experts and trying to follow along, making notes and frantically
looking things up. You learn to ask questions, and learn that there is no such thing as a stupid question.
The stupid question is the one you don't ask!

But is there more we can do?

## Strategies for managing impostor syndrome

The main thing is to take control of the narrative in your head. You need to learn to recognise what you bring
to the table, and how you can contribute to the project.

Here are some strategies that might help:

- Control the conversation in your head. Try not to think “Everyone here is brilliant… and I’m not” go with 
“Wow, everyone here is brilliant – I’m really going to learn a lot!”
- Just because you may feel stupid, doesn’t mean you are. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand something.
- Learn from your mistakes, but don't dwell on them.
- Remember that you are there for a reason. You have skills and knowledge that are valuable to the team.

## Final thoughts

I wish I had a quick and easy fix for dealing with impostor syndrome. Unfortunately, it's something that many of us 
will continue to face throughout our careers. But by implementing some of the strategies outlined above, 
we can learn to manage our feelings of inadequacy and build our confidence over time.

Knowing what it is called can be helpful. There's lots of advice out there on how to deal with it. 
We will also be compiling tips and suggestions from the community to include on this site. 
Not all the advice will work for you, but hopefully you will find something that helps.

And in the meantime, try to recognise your value.
And, if all else fails, it will get easier over time. Fake it til you make it!
