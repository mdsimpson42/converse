One thing I've learned doing this job is that one of the best things you can do to protect your
mental health is to set boundaries. This is something that became particularly important during the
pandemic, but continues to be a challenge as we all now seem to be working from home more often.

In this article, we'll discuss some of the ways that you can do this.
So, what exactly do we mean by setting boundaries?

## Setting Boundaries

When talking about how to improve mental health, one of the things we are focussing on is self care:
the things that we can control and what we can do to look after ourselves. One of the things we can
control is our life/work balance, and how to set clear boundaries to keep those things separate and
to help protect ourselves from anxiety, burnout and other issues.

### Life/Work Boundaries

This can mean creating boundaries between work and home life. This is relatively easy to do when you're going
into the office every day. When you're in the office you're at work and when you're not, you're not!
However, it can be harder to separate work and home life when you're not going into the office.

When I'm working from home, I like to "walk to work" by taking 10 minutes to walk around the block,
often after dropping my son off at school, before sitting at my desk. And the same at the end of the day, I
repeat the process to "commute" back home. Before the morning walk, and after the evening walk,
I keep work out of my mind and shut down all work related apps on my computer. I resist the temptation to
catch up on emails or other tasks, and focus on spending time with my family and doing the things
that bring me joy.

### Communication Boundaries

It can mean setting communication boundaries. A lot of us work more flexibly, and some of my colleagues
start work earlier than I do, or work later into the evening. My schedule is mostly defined by my childcare responsibilities.
Sometimes I do find myself working outside of normal hours, but I do not send any emails during this time. If I do need to
send a message, I schedule it to be sent at 9 am the following day.

I also do not have my work email or Slack on my phone. This means I can't be disturbed by someone trying to contact me
out of working hours, at weekends or when I'm on leave. This helps with that distinction between work and home life.

But it doesn't end there. I also don't have them Slack/Emails on my laptop or PC all the time. I get so many notifications
all the time, and they distract me from my work. If I need to focus, I shut them down so I cannot be interrupted.
Similarly, I know colleagues who have a "quiet Friday" policy, where they do not send or respond to emails to allow them
to focus on their work. My schedule is too chaotic to set aside a regular time for this, but it seems like a good idea,
that might work for you.

### Protected Time

It can mean protecting your time. I make sure to have at least 30 minutes for lunch between midday and 2 pm.
If a meeting would rob me of that, I just say no. Sometimes blocking things out in your calendar is a good idea,
particularly if colleagues can see your availability. They won't see that it's a break or other protected time.
I will also sometimes block my calendar every day before 9:30 am, to allow me to drop my son off at school
and get settled at my desk before having to jump into any meetings.

### Saying No

Speaking of which, learning to say no is also important. Blocking out your calendar and simply saying you aren't
available is a good example.

Obviously, you need to be reasonable and flexible. Some things are important, while other things could be good for
your career. But you should get comfortable with saying no, particularly if you are already too busy with other tasks,
or if you are struggling with your mental health.

## A Note for Managers

Finally, to any managers reading this who may not approve of some of these suggestions: trust in your team and
respect their diversity!

I've said it so many times, but if the people on your team have good mental health and life-work balance, then
they will be more productive. You can't force them to be productive by imposing rules on them! Also, everyone is different.
You cannot dictate how everyone should work. Those rules might work for you, and might work for the majority of your team,
but they won't work for everyone. You need to be flexible and allow people to work in a way that suits them.
As long as they are delivering the work you need from them, then it shouldn't matter how or when they do it.

## Final Thoughts

Setting boundaries is an important part of self-care, and it can take time and practice to get it right.
Be patient with yourself, and remember that it's okay to ask for help if you need it.
By taking steps to protect your time and energy, you can create a healthier work-life balance
and improve your overall well-being.
