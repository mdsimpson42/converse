I'd been looking for ways to support mental health in the research software community,
but I was struggling to find practical solutions. Then, a surprising idea emerged from a
conversation at the SSI's Collaborations Workshop in 2024.

## CW24

Collaborations Workshop is an amazing event, hosted each year by the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI).
The event takes place over three days, and you spend most of it splitting into groups to discuss a range of topics.
Usually, this includes things like generative AI, sustainability in high-performance computing and
maintenance of open-source software projects.

However, I had already decided to apply for the [SSI Fellowship](https://www.software.ac.uk/ssi-fellowship)
to continue the conversation around mental health in the community. And so, when we split into groups on day two
to discuss ideas for the Hack Day, we went around the table and introduced ourselves. I mentioned my interest in
mental health and the group was very supportive. I was surprised to find that many of them had similar experiences,
and we spent some time discussing the challenges we all faced and how they affected our mental health.

Then, someone mentioned that they had been using a task management system to help them manage their workload,
and how it had helped them with their life-work balance and wellbeing. I initially had a fairly visceral negative reaction
to this idea, but then someone else mentioned that they had done something similar. So, we discussed it
a bit further and came up with an idea that became the focus of our suggestion for a hack day project.

## Task Management for Humans as Self-Care

The idea was to create a carpentry-style course that would introduce a range of task management systems,
with the focus being on value for the individual, rather than on value for their employer.

There were some key principles: First, the course would focus on self-care and life-work balance,
rather than productivity. Second, it would introduce a range of task management systems, allowing participants to choose
the elements that work best for them. It wasn't a case of "do it this way or your doing it wrong", but rather
"here are some options, try them out and see what works for you".

The idea won the top prize for ideas session, and so it was selected for the hack day. On day three,
we worked together to create a course outline with some example content and deployed it to the Carpentries Incubator.
The project went on to win the top Hack Day prize.

## Final Thoughts

CW is always an amazing event, but CW25 was special. The engagement from everyone at the workshop was amazing.
I think this, combined with the fact that the project won both prizes, demonstrates that people understand how
important mental health is. It also shows that support can come from unexpected places and that great ideas emerge when
we share our experiences and work together.

The experience of working on this project inspired me to apply for the Fellowship, and I am excited to see what
other ideas will emerge from this amazing community. I also hope to bring together ideas like this on this website,
so that the whole community can benefit from them.
