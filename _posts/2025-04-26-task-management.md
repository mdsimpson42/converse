I'd been looking for ways to support mental health in the research software community,
and a surprising idea emerged from a conversation at the SSI's Collaboration Workshop in 2024.

## CW24

Collaboration Workshop is an amazing event, usually taking place over three days. You spend
a lot of your time splitting into groups to discuss a range of different topics. Usually,
this includes things like Generative AI, Sustainability in High-performance Computing and
maintenance of open-source software projects.

However, I had already decided to apply for the SSI Fellowship to continue the conversation around
mental health in the community. And so, when we split into groups on day two to discuss ideas for
the Hack Day, we went around the table and introduced ourselves. I mentioned my interest in mental health,
and the group was very supportive. I was surprised to find that many of them had similar experiences,
and we spent a lot of time discussing the challenges we face in our work and how they affect our mental health.

Then, someone mentioned that they had been using a task management system to help them manage their workload,
and how it had helped them with their life-work balance and wellbeing. I initially had a fairly visceral negative reaction,
but then someone else mentioned that they had done something similar using a different system. So, we discussed it
a bit further, and came up with an idea that became the focus of our suggestion for a hack day project.

## Task Management for Humans as Self-Care

The idea was to create a carpentry-style course that would introduce a range of task management systems,
with the focus being on value for the individual, rather than on value for their employer.

The idea went on to win the top prize for the best idea.

We went on to develop the course during the hack day on day three.
