One of the questions I've been asked while giving [my mental health talk]({{site.baseurl}}/talks)
is "where can I get support?" So, we've compiled a list of different options for who you can talk to.

Some of these resources are linked on our [resources page]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/tips),
but I wanted to list them here and discuss my experiences with each of them. As with a lot of things
on this site, it should be noted that this is MY experience, yours may vary.

## Where to get support

Some of the following focuses on academic institutions in the UK, which is where my experience lies.
But many of these resources are available in other countries and institutions, they may have different names
and provide different services, but hopefully this will give you a few possible starting points.

## 1. Talk to your line manager

Your first port of call should be your line manager. They may be able to provide support or make accommodations
for you if you are struggling.

As I said in my [how to support your team blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/2025/06/22/supporting-your-team),
there may be limits to what your line manager can do to support you. And, sadly, this question often seems to come from people
submitting anonymously, who are asking where to get help if their line manager is unwilling or unable to provide
the support they need. It can be frustrating, as I know all too well. It can also feel like they
are not taking your concerns seriously. However, we do have to be realistic. It will not always be possible
to push back deadlines or divert additional resources to support someone who is struggling.

But don't worry, there are other places you can go to get help.

## 2. Mental Health First Aiders

If there are [Mental Health First Aiders](https://mhfaengland.org/mhfa-centre/blog/What-is-a-mental-health-first-aider/)
in your team or institution, they can be a great first point of contact. You can talk to them anonymously, and they can signpost
other resources and services.

I [qualified as a Mental Health First Aider](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/becoming-mental-health-first-aider) in 2025,
as part of my preparation for the SSI fellowship. I found the training to be really useful, and I would definitely say that any
group would benefit from having at least one MHFAider on their team.

## 3. Employee Assistance Programme

Your institution may have an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) or similar. This is usually a service provided by
a third party, and you can self-refer yourself to it. They can provide confidential advice and support,
including free counselling or therapy sessions.

I have not used the EAP at my institution, but I have looked into it. They provide 24/7 support, including up to six
free counselling/therapy sessions. It probably won't "fix you", but it might help you get a diagnosis and start
on the road to recovery.

## 4. Occupational Health

Your institution's Occupational Health service will need to get involved in order to arrange time off work
or make accommodations for you if you are struggling. However, getting in touch with them may require
a referral from your line manager or HR department.

Occupational Health were the ones who recommended I take time of work to recover after
[my anxiety attack]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2025-03-14-backstory %}). They were patient and sympathetic,
and a lot less scary to talk to than I had imagined.

## 5. Your GP

Your GP can refer you to mental health services in your area and can prescribe medication if necessary.

I found my GP to be sympathetic, and the medication took the edge of my symptoms and allowed me to recover.
However, it did take a couple of months of trial and error with a range of drugs and doses before it started to
make a difference. I'd recommend contacting them as early as possible, and being patient and persistent while
you find the right treatment for you.

## 6. Therapy

There are many different types of therapy available, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), counselling and psychotherapy.
Some services are available through the NHS in the UK, but you might have to wait a while for an appointment. Alternatively,
you can pay for private therapy, which can be expensive but may be available more quickly.

After being bounced around slow and ineffective NHS services, I asked my GP if they could refer me to a private therapist.
This was one of the best decisions I ever made. After suffering for nearly a decade, I was able to finally get the help I needed
to recover (though it took over a year to get there!). It's hard work, and you might find that you feel worse before you start
to feel better, but it was worth it in the end.

## 7. Other organisations and charities

There are several organisations and charities that provide support, including some that specialise in particular
mental health issues or in supporting particular people, such as minority groups, disabled people and the LGBTQ+ community.

A good starting point might be to check out the list on our [Get Help page]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/get-help).

I can definitely recommend doing some research. I found the [Mind website](https://www.mind.org.uk/) to be a great resource.
It was on their website that I learned about CBT and decided that it sounded like something that would work for me.

## Final Thoughts

Seeking help for mental health issues can be daunting, and may require patience and perseverance,
but there are many resources available to support you. Don't be afraid to ask for help, and remember that
it might take time to find what works best for you. But, if you can find the right help, it can make
a huge difference.

Thanks for reading.  
Take care of yourselves.
