One of the questions I've been asked while giving my mental health talk is "where can I get support?"
Sadly, this question often seems to coms from people submitting anonymously, who are asking where to get
help if their line manager is not supportive or taking their concrns seriously. So, let's 
look at your options for where to get support.

Some of these resources are linked on our [resources page]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/tips), but I wanted to list them here and discuss my experiences with each of them. This is MY experience, yours may vary.

## Where to get support

Some of the following focuses on academic institutions in the UK, which is where my experience lies.
But many of these resources are available in other countries and institutions, they may have different names
and provide different services.

## 1. Talk to your line manager

Your first port of call should be your line manager. They may be able to provide support or make accommodations for 
you if you are struggling.

As I said in my [how to support your team blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/supporting-your-team), 
there may be limits to what your line manager can do
to support you. They may not be able to push back deadlines or divert additional resources to support you.

Unfortunately, as I know all too well, it may also feel like they are not taking your concerns seriously.
But don't worry, there are other places you can go to get help.

## 2. Mental Health First Aiders

If there are mental health first aiders in your team or institution, they can be a great first point of contact.

## 3. Employee Assistance Programme

Your institution may have an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) or similar.  This is usually a service provided by a third party, and you can self-refer yourself to it. They can provide confidential advice and support, including free counselling or therapy sessions.

## 4. Occupational Health

Your insitution's occupational health service will need to get involved in order to arrange time off work or make accommodations for you if you are struggling. This may require a referral from your line manager or HR department.

Occupational health were the ones who recommended I take tiem of work to recover after my anxiety attack.

## 5. Your GP

Your GP can refer you to mental health services in your area and can prescribe medication if necessary. 

I found my GP to be sympathetic, and the medication took the edge of my symptoms and allowed me to recover. However, it did take a couple of months of trial and error with a range of drugs and doses before it started to make a difference.

## 6. Therapy

There are many different types of therapy available, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), counselling and psychotherapy. Some services are 
available through the NHS in the UK, but you might have to wait a while for an appointment. Alternatively, you can pay for private therapy, which can be expensive but may be available more quickly. 

After being bounced around slow and ineffective NHS services, I asked my GP if they could refer me to a private therapist. This was one of the best decisions I ever made. After suffering for nearly a decade, I was able to finally get the help I needed to recover (though it took over a year to get there!)

## 7. Other organisations and charities

There are several organisations and charities that provide support, including some that specialise in particular mental health issues or in supporting minority groups, disabled people of the LGBTQ+ community.

A good starting point might be to check out the list on our [Get Help page]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/get-help).

I can definitely recommend doing some research. I found the [Mind website](https://www.mind.org.uk/) to be a great resource. It was on their website that I learned about CBT and decided that it sounded like something that would work for me.
