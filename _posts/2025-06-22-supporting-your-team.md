Another question I've been asked a few times while giving my mental health talk is "what can I do to support my team?"
I was pleasantly surprised by this, and its encouraging that so many managers are thinking about it.
But what can you do to look after the mental health of your team?

## Supporting your team

There are a few things you can do to support your team. We've tried to pull together some tips and advice on
our [resources page]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/tips). But in this blog post, I want
to focus on some key things that have come up during various conversations as I've been travelling
around the country, attending events and giving my mental health talk.

## Listen

The most important thing that you can do as a manager is to listen to your team. Give people
the opportunity to raise concerns and respond to those concerns appropriately. It's always easier to
address issues early on, and failing to do so can lead to much more serious problems in the long run.

Now, I fully acknowledge that it won't always be possible to push back deadlines or divert additional resources
to support someone who is struggling. However, it is important to listen and to take their concerns seriously,
and to do what you can, even if there doesn't seem to be much that you can do.

Even if there isn't much *you* can do, there may be resources or support available through your institution
that you can refer them to (I will discuss this later in this post).

I know first hand, the worst thing you can do is to make that person feel like you are not taking their
concerns seriously. This may lead to them feeling isolated and unsupported, which will only make things worse.

## Consider appointing a Mental Health First Aider

Mental Health First Aiders (MHFA), like regular first aiders, are trained to provide emergency
support to people who are experiencing a mental health crisis. They can help to identify warning signs
and are trained to approach/listen to people who are struggling and to signpost them to appropriate support services.

- MHFA training costs £325 per person (excluding VAT) and consists of a two-day course, which can be run
in-person or online.

That's not a lot, especially compared to the cost of someone having to take time off because they have burned out
or experienced an anxiety attack. I estimated that the total cost of my six week absence (which was mandated by
Occupational Health) after experiencing an anxiety attack would cost my institution as much as £12,000. Whereas the
MHFA training (even including the cost of someone taking two days off to complete it) is £1,200. If having an MHFA on
your team can prevent a prolonged absence, that is a definite investment in your team that pays off in terms of
happiness and productivity, as well as cold hard cash.

And don't just take my word for it, according to [MHFA England](https://www.mhfaengland.org/), absence due to poor
mental health is  responsible for 72 million missing days in 2019 <sub>[[1](https://mhfaengland.org/mhfa-centre/impact-report-2019.pdf)]</sub>,
costing as much as £57 billion <sub>[[2](https://mhfaengland.org/mhfa-centre/blog/Key-workplace-mental-health-statistics-for-2024/)]</sub>.

Our recommendation is that all leaders and line managers go through this training.

## Training and resources

There may be training courses on mental health available from your institution. This can help you to understand
what warning signs to look out for and how to refer people to the appropriate support services.

Your institution will have an occupational health service, who can help make accommodations for people who
are struggling. They may also have an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), or similar, which staff can self-refer
themselves to and get confidential support, including free counselling or therapy sessions.

We encourage you to spend some time learning what those resources are and how employees can access them.
While some offer self-referral, others will require line managers to refer them to hose services.

## Final thoughts

As managers, we have a responsibility to look after the mental health of our teams.
It won't always be possible to move heaven and earth to support someone, but by creating opportunities for
frank and honest conversations, being  sure to listen and take their concerns seriously,
you can help to create a better workplace culture, and make sure that everyone feels supported and valued.

how to support your team. We will be adding more to these pages over time.

about what managers can do to support better mental health in the workplace.

Thanks for reading.  
Take care of yourselves.
