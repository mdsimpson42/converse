Another question I've been asked a few times while giving my mental health talk is "what can I do to support my team?"
I was pleasantly surprised by this, and I think its encouraging that some managers are asking about it.
But what can you do to look after the mental health of your team?

## Supporting your team

There are a few things you can do to support your team. We've tried to pull together some tips and advice on
the [resources page]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/tips) of this site, but here are some things to consider. But in this blog post, I want
to focus on some key elements and things that have come up during conversations while giving my mental health talk.

## Listen

The most important thing I would say that you can do as a manager is to listen to what people are saying.

It won't always be possible to push back deadlines or divert additional resources to support an indivudal,
but the 

I know first hand, the worst thing you can do is to make that person feel like you are not taking their
concerns seriously. This may lead to them feeling isolated and unsupported, which will only make things worse
and could lead to much more serious problems in the long run.

## Consider appointing a mental health first aider

Mental health first aiders (MHFA), like regular First aiders, are trained to provide emergency 
support to people who are experiencing a mental health crisis. They can help to identify warning signs 
and are trained to approach/listen to people who are struggling and to signpost them to appropriate support services.

- MHFA training costs (at time of writing) Â£325 per person (excluding VAT) and is a two-day course.

That's not a lot, especially compared to the cost of someone having to take time off because they have burned out 
or experienced an anxiety attack.

## Training and resources

There may be training courses on mental health available from your institution. This can help you to understand
what warning signs to look out for and how to refer people to the appropriate support services. 

Your institution will have an occupational health service, who can help make accommodations for people who
are struggling. They may also have an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), or similar, which staff can self-refer
themselves to and get confidential support, including free counselling or therapy sessions.

## Final thoughts

As managers, we have a responsibility to look after the mental health of our teams.
It won't always be possible to move heaven and earth to support someone, but by making sure to listen 
to your team and to take their concerns seriously, you can help to create a better workplace culture,
and make sure that everyone feels supported and valued.

how to support your team. We will be adding more to these pages over time.
