title: About ConveRSE

<p>
  Mental health problems can affect us all. 1 in 4 people in England experience a mental health problem each year 
  [<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/mental-health-facts-and-statistics/">Mind</a>].
</p>
<p>
  Looking after your mental health is important, and we want to help you do that, but our main mission is to emphasise
  how important it is for people are to to talk about mental health in the workplace, so they can get support and 
  address issues <i>before</i> they grow into larger problems.

<h2>Challenges for RSEs</h2>
<p>
    We are a relatively new profession, with limited recognition and career development options. We often work alone,
    and have to do a lot of context and technology switching. We work with researchers who are world leaders 
    in fields we know nothing about, which can lead to impostor syndrome.
