<h3>Getting Help and Support</h3>
<p>
  If you are struggling, and feel like you need additional support, there are a number of options available.
  There are a number of organisations that can provide more information and support about a range of problems, 
  if you need urgent help. These are discussed in more detail on our <a href="support.html">Get Help</a> page.
  If your situation is less urgent, you might consider the options below.
</p>
<p>It can be daunting to talk to your colleagues and line manager about your mental health, but remember:</p>

    <b>Support from your Institution</b> - most universities have an Employee Assistance Programme or similar, which provides
    confidential support and advice, often including free counselling sessions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Mental Health First Aiders</b> - provides initial support to individuals experiencing mental health challenges,
    much like a first aider would provide first aid for a physical injury
  </li>

    <b>Occupational Health</b> - if the situation is more serious, occupational health may be able to help evaluate and support your needs,
    including giving you time off to recover. You may need a referral from your line manager or HR department.

    <b>Your Doctor/GP</b> - your doctor may have useful advice and can also prescribe medication to help manage your condition.
