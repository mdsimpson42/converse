    <h2>Looking after your team</h2>
    <p>Tips for RSE leaders for looking after your team:</p>
    <h3>Listen</h3>
    <p>
        The most important thing you can do as a leader and line manager is to listen to your team.
        If someone comes to you with a concern, make sure to listen to what they have to say,
        and take their concern seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should also do what you can to help support that person. However, we accept that there are 
        limits to what you can do. You may not be able to move deadlines, assign other team members,
        or help the person yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The worst thing you can do is to make the person feel like you are ignoring them, that you don't 
        appreciate them and that you are not taking their concerns seriously. This can lead to them feeling
        isolated and unsupported, which will only make the situation worse.

    <h3>Consider appointing a Mental Health First Aider</h3>
    <p>
        Having a Mental Health First Aider (MHFA) in your team can help to create a supportive environment 
        where people feel able to talk about their mental health. Mental Health First Aiders are trained to listen, 
        reassure and respond, and can also signpost further support if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        MHFA training costs Â£325 and is delivered by a number of charities and organisations across the UK. 
        The training is usually delivered over two days, in-person or online, and covers a range of mental health conditions,
        as well as how to support someone who is experiencing a mental health crisis.
