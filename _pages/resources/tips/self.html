  <h2>Looking after yourself</h2>
  <p>On this page, we focus on self-help; tips & advice to help you manage your own mental health and wellbeing.</p>
  <h3>Self-Care</h3>
  <p>
    Self-care is about looking after yourself, doing what makes you feel good, and taking time to recharge your batteries. 
    Self-care is not selfish. After all, you cannot do your job effectively, or be there to support your friends and family,
    if you're burned out. You can't pour from an empty cup, and sometimes you need to make time to refill it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We all know what we need to do, but it isn't always easy to find the time or motivation. Getting enough sleep, eating well, 
    exercising, getting in touch with nature... all these things are important. So is spending time with our loved ones and making 
    time for the things we enjoy. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As Mike says in his talk, we don't want to be the ones who say "You look stressed, have you tried yoga?". But research has shown 
    that Yoga and other mindfulness techniques can be very effective in helping to manage stress and anxiety. You need to find what
    works for you.

  <h3>Getting Help and Support</h3>
  <p>
    If you are struggling, and feel like you need additional support, there are a range of options available.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are organisations that can provide more information about a range of problems, as well as provide emergency support. 
    These are discussed in more detail on our <a href="support.html">Get Help</a> page.
  </p>
  <h4>Support at work</h4>
  <p>It can be daunting to talk to your colleagues and line manager about your mental health. You may be worried that 
    they won't take you seriously, or that they might view it as a sign of weakness. But remember:</p>

    <p><b>"It's better to raise a red flag before you're forced to wave a white one."</b></p>

  <p>
    Nobody is invincible, and if you struggle for too long, you may end up burning out or developing more serious conditions 
    that will require you to take time off and may take years of hard work and therapy to recover from. It is always easier 
    to raise an issue before it becomes a problem. By admitting that you are struggling, you might be able to get support.
