  <p>On this page, we focus on self-help; tips & advice to help you manage your own mental health and wellbeing.</p>
  <h2>Self-Care</h2>
  <p>
    Self-care is about looking after yourself, doing what makes you feel good, and taking time to recharge your batteries. 
    Self-care is not selfish. After all, you cannot do your job effectively, or be there to support your friends and family,
    if you're burned out. You can't pour from an empty cup, and sometimes you need to make time to refill it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We all know what we need to do, but it isn't always easy to find the time or motivation. Getting enough sleep, eating well, 
    exercising, getting in touch with nature... all these things are important. So is spending time with our loved ones and making 
    time for the things we enjoy. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As Mike says in his talk, we don't want to be the ones who say "You look stressed, have you tried yoga?", but research has shown 
    that Yoga and other mindfulness techniques can be very effective in helping to manage stress and anxiety. You need to find what
    works for you.
  </p>
  <h2>Getting Help and Support</h2>
  <p>
    If you are struggling, and feel like you need additional support, there are a range of options available.
  </p>
  <h3>Mental Health organisations</h3>
  <p>
    There are organisations that can provide more information about a range of problems, as well as provide emergency support. 
    These are discussed in more detail on our <a href="support.html">Get Help</a> page.
  </p>
  <h3>Support at work</h3>
  <p>It can be daunting to talk to your colleagues and line manager about your mental health. You may be worried that 
    they won't take you seriously, or that they might view it as a sign of weakness. But remember:</p>
  <div class="quote light-quote">
      <p>
          "It's better to raise a red flag,<br class="quote-break">
          before you're forced to wave a white one!"
      </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Nobody is invincible, and if you struggle for too long, you may end up burning out or developing more serious conditions 
    that will require you to take time off and may take years of hard work and therapy to recover from. It is always easier 
    to raise an issue before it becomes a problem. By admitting that you are struggling, you might be able to get support. 
  </p>

    <li>
      <b>Your line manager</b> - they may be able to provide additional support or make adjustments to your workload 
      or deadlines.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Mental Health First Aiders</b> - are trained to provide confidential support to people experiencing mental health issues,
      and can signpost additional sources of information and support.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Support from your Institution</b> - most universities have an Employee Assistance Programme, which can provide
      confidential support and advice, often including free counselling sessions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Occupational Health</b> - occupational health may be able to help evaluate and support your needs,

      You may need a referral from your line manager or HR department.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your Doctor/GP</b> - your doctor may have useful advice and can also refer you to specialists and other methods of support, 
      as well as prescribing medication that may help manage your condition.

  <h3>Self-care Suggestions</h3>
  <p>
    It's difficult to give advice on self-care, as everyone is different. What works for me might not work for you.
    However, here are some suggestions that you might find helpful:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Setting Boundaries</b> - Splitting up your work day, especially when you're working from home, 
      or turning off notifications outside of work hours can make a huge difference. Read more about it in 
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2025/09/28/setting-boundaries.html">this blog post</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Writing</b> - Some people find journalling to be a useful tool. Mike found it more useful to 
      write about his experience in a different way, as he explains in 
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2025/03/20/writing.html">this blog post</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Hobbies</b> - One of the top responses to 
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2025/11/19/issues-and-solutions.html">Mike's survey</a>
      was to find a creative hobby. Not only that but "find a hoby that does not look like work", i.e. something
      that doesn't involve sitting in the same office in front of the same computer screen that you've been working
      at all day!
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Task Management Apps</b> - As Mike has discussed in
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2025/04/25/task-management.html">this blog post</a>,
      task management tools can help you to manage your workload more effectively, and help deal with anxiety and
      feelings of inadequacy. Mike recommends Todoist, which allows you to set tasks, including recurring tasks,
      and categorise them. Not only will it help you get on top of your work, but ticking off completed tasks
      can give you a buzz, like levelling up in a video game! (Stay tuned for a longer blog post on this topic).
