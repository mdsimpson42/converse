<p>
    This section provides tips and advice on how to manage mental health and wellbeing.
    We have divided the tips into three categories: looking after yourself, looking after your colleagues, 
    and looking after your team.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the tips have been submitted by members of the community, during various workshops and Mike's 
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/talks">fellowship talks</a>.
