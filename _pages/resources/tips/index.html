<p>
    This section provides tips and advice on how to manage mental health and wellbeing.
    We have divided the tips into three categories: looking after yourself, looking after your colleagues, 
    and looking after your team.

    Click on the tabs to switch between the categories.

    Some of the tips have been submitted by members of the community, during various workshops and Mike's fellowship talks.
