        If you are concerned about the wellbeing of a colleague, or your team in general, then there are a few things
        we can recommend.
    </p>
    <h2>Consider becoming a Mental Health First Aider</h2>
    <p>
        By training as a Mental Health First Aider (MHFA), you are equipping yourself to help support colleagues in a crisis,
        and to advocate for better mental health in your workplace. We particularly recommend this if you plan to
        be a team lead or line manager in the future.
    </p>
    <p>You can find more information on the MHFA association websites:</p>
