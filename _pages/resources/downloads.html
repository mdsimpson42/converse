<p>
    As part of the ConveRSE project, we want to create a number of resources that can be used by
    the community to support mental health in the workplace.
</p>
<p>
    For example, we hope to create:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Posters that you can display in your workplace</li>
    <li>Leaflets with useful information for your team/colleagues</li>
    <li>Downloadable documents</li>
    <li>Example templates for policies and procedures</li>
</ul>
<h2>Leaflet: "Let's Talk About Mental Health"</h2>
<p>
    We have created a leaflet, which Mike has been handing out whenever he gives his talk.
</p>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/flyer.jpg" class="centered-image"
    alt="The front and back of the ConveRSE 'Let's Talk about Mental Health' leaflet">
<p>
    It is a double-sided, A5 leaflet, containing: some mental health statistics,
    what to do if you are struggling, some charities that support mental health,
    information about the ConveRSE project and how to get involved.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can download a PDF version  
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/downloads/converse-leaflet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
