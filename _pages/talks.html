<p>
    As part of his Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) Fellowship, 
    Mike Simpson has been giving talks on mental health in the Research Software Community.
</p>
<p>
    The aim of these talks is to raise awareness of mental health issues, 
    share personal experiences, and provide practical tips for managing mental health in the workplace.
    The talks are designed to be interactive, with plenty of time for questions and discussion.
</p>

    Mike has been working as a Research Software Engineer (RSE) for over 7 years, and has also worked
    as a research associate and as a software developer in the games industry.

    He has also experienced mental health issues himself, having lived with anxiety and depression for 
    over a decade. He became a father in 2020, which led to burnout and an anxiety attack.
