<h2>Blog Submissions</h2>
<p>
    We would like to encourage as many people, from a wide and diverse range of backgrounds, to contribute to the blog.
    You could share your mental health story, talk about your experiences with mental health in academia, 
    or discuss how you have supported others. You could share tips and advice, or links to resources that you have found helpful.
</p>
<p>
    When you submit a blog post, you can choose to do so anonymously or you can create an author profile.
    If you choose to create an author profile, you can include a short bio and a photo of yourself, 
    as well as links to your social media profiles or website.
</p>
<h3>How to Submit</h3>
<p>
    There are two ways to submit a blog post.
</p>
<h4>1. Pull Request</h4>
<p>
    The site is a Jekyll app hosted on GitHub pages. You can add a blog post to the site via a pull request on 
    <a href="{{site.data.var.github_url}}">the GitHub repository</a>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1 - create a branch/fork of the repository.</li>
    <li>Step 2 - add your blog post (plus author profile, tags and images) to the code.</li>
    <li>Step 3 - commit your changes and create a pull request to merge them onto the main branch.</li>
    <li>Step 4 - your changes will be deployed automatically once the pull request has been approved.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Full instructions can be found on 
    <a href="{{site.data.var.github_url}}wiki">the repository's wiki.</a>
</p>
<h4>2. Web Form</h4>
<p>
    We understand that not everyone is familiar with GitHub or has an account.
    If you would prefer, you can submit a blog post using the form below.

<h2>Contributing to the Site</h2>
<p>
    As you can probably tell, I am not a web developer! If you have ideas for how to improve the site,
    particularly changes that will make it  as user-friendly and accessible as possible, 
    please get in touch. I would be very grateful for any help.
