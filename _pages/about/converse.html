    The ConveRSE project aims to continue the conversation around mental health in the research software community,
    and to provide resources and support for RSEs and other RTPs who may be struggling with their mental health.

  <h2>Continuing the Conversation</h2>
  <p>
    Mental health problems can affect us all. 1 in 4 people in England experience a mental health problem each year 
    <sub>[<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/mental-health-facts-and-statistics/">Mind</a>]</sub>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking after your mental health is important, and we want to help you do that, but our main mission is to emphasise
    how important it is for people are to to talk about mental health in the workplace, so they can get support and 
    address issues. It is particularly important to get support early, as it is nearly always easier and cheaper to
    address those issues <i>before</i> they grow into larger problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is when people suffer in silence that problems can worsen, sometimes to the point where they lead to burnout and 
    long-term absence, or to people leaving the profession, or worse. Suicide is still the leading cause of death for
    men under the age of 50 <sub>[<a href="https://www.thecalmzone.net/life-saving-stats">CALM</a>]</sub>. 
    We want to smash the stigma around mental health, especially in the workplace. 
    By encouraging the conversation, we hope to create a better, more supportive environment for everyone.

  <h2>Challenges for RSEs</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to the challenges that we all face, RSEs also face a unique set of challenges
    that can impact our mental health, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>We are a relatively new profession, with limited recognition and career development options.</li>
      <li>We often work alone,which can lead to feelings of isolation.</li>
      <li>We have to do a lot of context and technology switching, which can be exhausting and lead to burnout.</li> 
      <li>
        We work with researchers who are world leaders in fields we know nothing about, 
        which can lead to impostor syndrome.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These challenges are not necessarily unique to RSEs, but they are prevalent in our community, and in 
    the Digital Research Technical Professional (dRTP) and Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI)
    spaces. That is why we created ConveRSE - to provide information, resources and support for people in 
    these communities.

  <h2>Mike's SSI Fellowship</h2>
  <p>
    The project was made possible thanks to the support of
    <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/">the Software Sustainability Institute</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contributors/mike_simpson.html">Mike Simpson</a> is a Research Software Engineer at Newcastle University, and a 2025 SSI Fellow. 
    He has a long history of mental health issues, and knows how difficult it can be to talk about them,
    or to ask for help. It was his past experience with poor mental health in the workplace that motivated him
    to apply for an SSI Fellowship to continue the conversation around mental health in the research
    software community.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2025, Mike was awarded an SSI Fellowship. The Fellowship is funding the development of this website, 
    as well as talks and workshops to raise awareness of mental health issues affecting RSEs and other technical
    professionals working in academia.
