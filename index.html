<p>Hello and welcome to the ConveRSE website!</p>

<p>
    The aim of ConveRSE is to continue the conversation around mental health in the Research Software Community.
    Looking after your mental health is important, and we want to help you do that, but our main mission is to emphasise
    how important it is for people are to to talk about mental health in the workplace, so they can get support and 
    address issues <i>before</i> they grow into larger problems.
</p>
<p>
    This site is intended to be a hub for information, resources and blog posts about mental health, aimed at 
    - but not exclusively for - Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and Research Technical Professionals (RTPs).

<h2>Supporting Mental Health in the Research Software Community</h2>
<p>
    Mental health problems can affect us all. 1 in 4 people in England experience a mental health problem each year 
    [<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/mental-health-facts-and-statistics/">Mind</a>].
    Lots of things can impact our mental health, but RSEs and other technical professionals working in academia face a unique set of challenges.
</p>
<p>
    We are a relatively new profession, with limited recognition and career development options. We often work alone,
    and have to do a lot of context and technology switching. We work with researchers who are world leaders 
    in fields we know nothing about, which can lead to imposter syndrome. Left unchecked, we are at risk of 
    a range of mental health problems, such as <a href="tags/burnout.html">burnout</a>, 
    <a href="tags/depression.html">depression</a> and <a href="tags/anxiety.html">anxiety</a>.

        <b>"If we want research software to be more sustainable,<br>
        we have to help sustain the people writing the software too!"</b>
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    But perhaps, with the right support, we can help look after each other and ourselves, and help take some of
    the pressure off and make things easier for ourselves and our colleagues.

<h2>The ConveRSE site</h2>
<p>
    The aim of this site is to provide a centralised resource for mental health information and support, 
    as well as a platform for sharing experiences and advice.
</p>
<p>
    The site will include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="tips/self">Tips and advice</a> on self-care and mental health, tailored to the needs of the Research Software Community.
    </li>
    <li>
        The results of <a href="survey">Dave Horsfall's Survey into Mental Health</a>
        n the Research Software Community, conducted in 2022.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <a href="blog">blog</a> containing stories, tips and advice on self-care and mental health from members of the community.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="support">Links</a> to other resources and support networks.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We believe that by sharing experiences and resources from a wide and diverse set of contributors,  
    we can support ourselves and each other, and help to improve the mental health and wellbeing of the community.

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>
    My name is <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/mike-simpson">Mike Simpson</a>, 
    and I am a Research Software Engineer at Newcastle University, Trustee and Vice-president of the Society of RSE
    and a 2025 SSI Fellow. 
</p>
<p>    
    I have a long history of mental health issues, and I know how difficult it can be to talk about them. 
    I also know how hard it can be to ask for help, and how easy it is to feel isolated and alone.
    But I've also learned that it's better to talk about an issue before it becomes a problem.
</p>
<div class="quote">
    <p>
        <b>"It's better to raise a red flag,<br>
        before you're forced to wave a white one!"</b>
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    That is why I applied for an SSI Fellowship, to continue the conversation around mental health in our community and 
    because I believe that by sharing our experiences, we can help support each other.
