<p>Hello and welcome to the ConveRSE website!</p>
<p>
    The aim of the ConveRSE project is to continue the conversation around mental health in the Research Software Community.
    This site is intended to be a hub for information, resources and blog posts about mental health, aimed at 
    - but not exclusively for - Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and Research Technical Professionals (RTPs).

    We believe that by sharing experiences and resources from a wide and diverse set of contributors,  
    we can support ourselves and each other, and help to improve the mental health and wellbeing of the community.

<h2>Supporting Mental Health in the Research Software Community</h2>
<p>
    
    Lots of things can impact our mental health, but RSEs and other technical professionals working in academia 
    face a unique set of challenges. Left unchecked, we are at risk of a range of mental health problems.
</p>
<div class="quote">
    <p>
        "If we want to make research software more sustainable,<br>
        we have to help sustain the people writing the software too!"
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    But with the right support, maybe we can help take the pressure off 
    and find ways to look after ourselves and our colleagues.

<h2>Continuing the Conversation</h2>
<p>
    My name is <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/mike-simpson">Mike Simpson</a>, 
    and I am a Research Software Engineer at Newcastle University and a 2025 SSI Fellow. 
    I have a long history of mental health issues, and I know how difficult it can be
    to talk about them, or to ask for help. But I've also learned that it's better to talk about an issue
    before it becomes a problem.
</p>
<div class="quote">
    <p>
        "It's better to raise a red flag,<br>
        before you're forced to wave a white one!"
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    I applied for an SSI Fellowship to continue the conversation around mental health in our community, 
    because I believe that by sharing our experiences, we can make people feel seen and help support one another.
